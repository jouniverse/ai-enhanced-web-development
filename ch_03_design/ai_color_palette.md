### Secondary Colors

1. **Silver (#C0C0C0)**: Adds a touch of elegance and luxury. It works well for accents and highlights, providing a modern and polished look.
2. **White (#FFFFFF)**: Represents purity, simplicity, and cleanliness. It’s perfect for backgrounds and creating a crisp, clean design.

### Accent Colors

1. **Burgundy (#800020)**: Adds a touch of warmth and richness. It’s an excellent accent color that can be used sparingly to draw attention to specific elements like call-to-action buttons or important information.
2. **Gold (#D4AF37)**: Conveys luxury and high quality. It can be used for subtle highlights and to accentuate the brand's premium nature.

### Neutral Colors

1. **Light Gray (#D3D3D3)**: A versatile color that can be used for backgrounds and to create contrast with darker elements.
